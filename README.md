# CS290 Final Project

I recieved full credit on this project, finishing the class with over 100%.

## What This Project Does:

Uploads a file from your computer

Homepage displays all the files, when an image is present it'll give you a thumbnail

Each tile has a button to directly link to the file, link to a page with comments, or to delete the file (no confirmation prompt)

On the single view page for each file, any comments will be displayed along with the time they were posted, and an option is given to add more comments.

Simple little file depot/image board concept.

I used Express, Handlebars, Mongodb, Multer, GridFS, and Method Override
